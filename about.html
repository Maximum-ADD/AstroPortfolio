                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Suffered heavy adrenal burnout. Learnt what unburdened peace feels like for the first time.</li>
                                            <li>Tried building projects. Learnt Git. </li>

                                            <li>Learnt how to not just ignore people but how to dislike them and what the stand for. When someone does something disrespectful or stupid I can now publically call them out without feeling like I am forgoing my morals. Some people, just the way they are, I can no longer get myself to be close to them.</li>

                                            <li>Partook in an Internship at CFruit Differently. I was lost the whole time but I had the immense honour of staying with the CEO. I learnt intimately the structure and procedure of a manufacturer / wholesaler company, what a healthy work community looks like, and the mindset of a CEO. </li>
                                            <li>Got robbed and experienced the effects of trauma for the first time. I no longer trust strangers and treat people who expect something from me with disdain. Beggars beware! I apologise.</li>
                                            <Li>Dedicated myself to social expression.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Learnt how much people value reputation and how speaking to people who do feels soulless as connecting with you is only their secondary goal. I stopped valuing my reputation as much.</li>
                                                <li>Learnt what it means to "be myself".</li>
                                                <li>Learnt how people will use you without realising it.</li>
                                                <li>Learnt how to dress better.</li>
                                                <li>Learnt to ignore people.</li>

                                        </Li>
                                        <li>Learnt how to make soap! It was really interesting and fun to mix differnt oils to give the soap different properties.</li>
                                        <li>Broke up with Girlfriend &lt;/3 (honestly so glad)</li>

                                        <ul> 
                                            <li>Achieved 5th place in school; 84% average</li>
                                        
                                            <li>Was extremely good at Visual Arts.(only by the teacher's standard) Got every Art award possible. (except most improved) (I COULDN'T LOSE! I know because I put in less effort each time and still got 100%! My absolute artistic freedom destroyed my phsyce and confused my peers.)</li>
                                            <li>Got the Noel Scheepers Druce Hall Senior Award for being an exemplary student within the boarding house. (shucks it had some problems. SHHHH don't tell anyone I did this but I snitched on the comunial drug stash in the bathroom. noone from my 2023 year can know. Don't tell them! SHHH!!!)</li>
                                            <li>Had mini existential crisis right before finals. Burntout completely. Had no motivation to do anything I used to. Sat under a tree an hour a day to remember what it felt like to want something.</li>
                                            <li>Made a YouTube channel to get overe the fear of expressing myself to the world. Impromptu Speaking: Verbal fluency improved, social fear decreased enough to be decent at a waitoring job, articulation improved, critical thinking / situational awareness grew, self respect improved. </li>
                                            <li>Participated in my first job. Waitoring in a Wedding venue. Learn't first hand how utterly useless I was in the real world despite the respect I got from everyone from m academics. </li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>Dropped 4 subjects. (including IT it was the only one inwhich the teacher said I didn't need it to do well in a career in programming since I was so ahead of the class. Just saying. ¬¨‚Äø¬¨ I was making video games in class instead of doing my work. Delphi was tough to make a physics engine in. :P Not that it matters anymore. )</li>
                                            <li>Got my first Girlfriend &lt;3. (Geez. Thank goodness I did. Now I know I don't need one.)</li>
                                            <li>Got into meditation.</li>

                                            <li>Covid happened. Taught me how destructive the endless void of online content is. No matter what, when you get sucked in, you might aswell have stopped existing. Modern technology is a dream fot all those who would rather not exist. A stranglehold on your brain is formed and your beliefs become as baseless as less creative myths of less impressive grandure from a source forgotten. You have no thought of your own. It is only in regret that I can hate the ever oozing sloth that I partook in for 6 months while I was 15. lol</li>

It is fun and earns me prestige. I find the main issue with learning is the attitude of doubt that seems to infect groups. This must be broken down first for any information to be useful.</p>

                                    I have lost my ambition. 
                                    I learnt time and time again that the easiest way to accept something is to give up on it. 
                                    I will enjoy life. 
                                    I won't strive to be the best because the best is narrowly placed. 
                                    I won't strive to be liked because people are pretentious and shouldn't have permission to control me. 
                                    I won't beleive anything fully because beliefs are only estimations. The common things in life sometimes aren't useful. 
                                    Something are best given up on. 
                                    There is no mission to obssess over only vague notions of a colourful life I could live. 
                                    A business, a wife, children -- Maybe oneday I could help the children of poverty that desperately greet me whenever I walk out of Wits.
                                    Maybe I might start to see them without the disdain for which my empathy has blossomed into. 
                                    Ambition is born from struggle.
                                    So is helplessness. 
                                    The determining factor seems to be who we beleive holds responsibility for that struggle.
                                    But I don't struggle.
                                    Right now ambition isn't useful.
                                    Perhaps compassion is my only avenue to be motivated towards something grander than myself.
                                    Surely it is enjoyable.

                                        <p>If you read through my portfolio website, you'll see that I take relationships seriously and could never connect with those I dislike unless my livelihood depended on it. Comunication is way more than relationships. It is expressing reason, and satisfying others by taking some control of a situation. That's how someone shows his competence and knowledge and how most problems involving interpersonal relationships are solved.</p>
