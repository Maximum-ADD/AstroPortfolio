                                            <li>Partook in an Internship at CFruit Differently. The experience was fresh and immensely curious. I had the immense honour of staying with the CEO. I learnt intimately the structure and procedure of a manufacturer / wholesaler company, what a healthy work culture looks like, and the leadership and strategic thinking of a CEO. </li>
                                            <li>Got robbed and assaulted and experienced the effects of trauma for the first time. I no longer trust strangers. </li>
                                            <Li>Dedicated myself to social expression.
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>Learnt that valuing reputation leads people to form connections which they would not endorse. (#Fake-friends) So now I see reputation as a byproduct not the goal.</li>
                                                    <li>Learnt how people will use you unapoligetically.</li>
                                                    <li>Grew an identity.</li>
                                                    <li>Learnt to enforce social boundries even if it burns bridges.</li>

                                            <li>Learnt how to make soap! It was really fun to mix differnt oils to give the soap different properties.</li>
                                            
                                            <li>1st Year Bachelor's in Computer Science; Wits Univesity.</li>

                                        <ul> 
                                            <li>Achieved 5th place in school; 84% average</li>
                                        
                                            <li>Was extremely good at Visual Arts. Got every Art award possible. (except most improved) (I COULDN'T LOSE! I know because I put in less effort each time and still got 100%! I had no right to be getting those marks. My absolute artistic freedom destroyed my phsyce and confused my peers.)</li>
                                            <li>Got the Noel Scheepers Druce Hall Senior Award for being an exemplary student within the boarding house. (SHHHH don't tell anyone I did this but I think this is why i got the award; I snitched on the comunial drug stash in the bathroom. noone from my 2023 year can know. Don't tell them! SHHH!!!)</li>
                                            <li>Had mini existential crisis right before finals. Burntout completely. Had no motivation to do anything. I sat under a tree an hour a day to remember what it felt like to want something.</li>
                                            <li>Made a YouTube channel to get over the fear of expressing myself to the world. Impromptu Speaking: Verbal fluency improved, social fear decreased enough to be decent at a waitoring job, articulation improved, critical thinking / situational awareness grew, self respect improved. </li>
                                            <li>Participated in my first job. Waitoring in a Wedding venue. Learnt first hand how utterly useless I was in the real world despite the respect I got from everyone from my academics. </li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>Dropped 4 subjects. (including IT. It was the only one inwhich the teacher said I didn't need it to do well in a career in programming since I was ahead of the class. I was making video games in class instead of doing my work. Turns out, self-directed learning starts with ignoring instructions. Delphi was a weird language to make a physics engine in. Not that it matters anymore -- thank goodness. )</li>
                                            <li>Got into meditation.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>Covid happened. Taught me how destructive the endless void of online content is. No matter what, when you get sucked in, you might aswell have stopped existing. Modern technology is a dream for all those who would rather not exist. A stranglehold on your brain is formed and your beliefs become as baseless as less creative myths of less impressive grandure from a source forgotten in a sea of slop. You have no thought of your own. It is only in regret that I can hate the ever oozing sloth that I partook in for 6 months while I was 15. lol</li>

                                    <p>I love the mountains. There are some beautiful places in South Africa that are to die for! Moreover, hiking clears your head. It gets your to process and undo your urgent thoughts. Love it plain and simple. Sometimes I like to scare myself and do mountain climbing aswell!</p>

                                    <p>Occasionally I like to help my struggling peers in subjects I have studied. I will compile my knowledge into a pdf or word Doc for them to learn from. It is fun and earns me prestige. I find the main issue with learning is the attitude of doubt that seems to infect groups. This must be broken down first for any information to be useful.</p>

                                Ambition is seemingly born from struggle, and so is helplessness. What determines which seems to be who we assign the responsibility for those struggles. Right now, my drive comes from curiosity and compassion more than any struggle. But that's enough.

                                        <p>If you read through my portfolio website, you'll see that I take relationships seriously and could never connect with those I dislike unless my livelihood depended on it. Comunication is way more than relationships. It is expressing reason, and satisfying others by taking some control of a situation. That's how someone shows his competence and knowledge and how most problems involving interpersonal relationships are solved.</p>
